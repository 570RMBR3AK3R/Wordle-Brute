-A BACKTRACKING ALGORITHM POWERED BY Python and MySQL

-DEVELOPED BY ANIRUDH AJITHKUMAR


WHAT THE PROGRAM IS ABOUT---->

-WORD CRACK 2 IS A PROGRAM INTENDED TO CRACK THE FAMOUS INTERNET GAME WORDLE
-THIS PROGRAM MAKES USE OF THE COMBINED FUNCTIONALITY OF PYTHON AND MYSQL TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY WORD
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS---> 

<---BEFORE RUNNING THE MAIN PROGRAM (wordle-brute-2.py)------------>

1)RUN THE database-creator.py TO CREATE A DATABASE TO STORE THE POSSIBLE FIVE LETTER WORDS
2)YOU WILL BE PROMPTED TO ENTER THE PASSWORD
3)LIST OF ALL POSSIBLE FIVE LETTER WORDS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED IN THE pw_list.dat (AROUND 3000+ words) FROM WHICH THE PROGRAM WILL READ THE WORDS INTO THE 
DATABASE. 


<------WHILE RUNNING THE PROGRAM---------->

1)ENTER YOUR SQL PASSWORD TO CONNECT TO YOUR SQL DATABASE
2)ALL THE LETTERS INPUT MUST BE "CAPITAL LETTERS" 
3)ALL THE LETTERS MUST BE INPUT "WITHOUT" WHITESPACES BEFORE ,BETWEEN OR AFTER THEM

EXAMPLE - Enter the letter(s) not present in the word - RTH

4)WHEN ENTERING THE LETTERS IN THEIR POSTIONS(OPTION 2) , LEAVE AN UNDERSCORE WHERE LETTER NOT KNOWN

      EXAMPLE - Enter the letter(s) with their correct positions ( _ where letter not known) - _S___
      (S IS THE SECOND LETTER , SO ONE UNDERSCORE HAVE BEEN LEFT BEFORE S , AND THREE UNDERSCORE HAVE BEEN LEFT AFTER S)

      EXAMPLE 2 - Enter the letter(s) with their correct positions ( _ where letter not known) - H_T__
      (ONE UNDERSCORE AFTER H , TWO UNDERSCORE AFTER T)

HERE LETTERS IN POSITION REFERS TO LETTERS IN GREEN IN WORDLE

*****THE SAME APPLIES FOR LETTERS OUT OF POSITION (OPTION 3) (here out of position refers to the letters in yellow in Wordle)****

**IMPORTANT -- > WHEN YOU ENTER A WORD THAT HAS TWO LETTERS REPEATING ,ONE OF THE LETTERS MIGHT NOT BE PRESENT (WHICH MEANS THAT LETTER ONLY REPEATS ONCE IN 
THE WORD) . ***DO NOT** USE OPTION 1 AND AND INPUT THE LETTER AS NOT PRESENT IN THE WORD -- THIS WOULD RESULT IN WORDS BEING DELETED THAT HAS THAT LETTER
WHICH WILL NOT GIVE YOU THE ANSWER

	EXAMPLE WORD - DRIER

	MAYBE THE FIRST 'R' IS NOT THERE IN THE WORD , BUT IF LAST 'R' IS EITHER YELLOW OR GREEN , THIS MEANS THAT THE WORD CONTAINS R WHICH ONLY COMES ONCE


5)ONLY USE OPTION 2 AFTER DOING EITHER OPTION 1 OR 3 ----------> IMPORTANT

6)YOU CAN VIEW THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE WORDS USING OPTION 4

7)YOU CAN VIEW THE LIST OF POSSIBLE WORDS USING OPTION 5



<---------AFTER USING THE PROGRAM---------->

1)AFTER USING THE PROGRAM YOU COULD EXIT MANUALLY , IF SO PLEASE CLEAR DATABASE USING OPTION 7. EXITING THE PROGRAM VIA OPTION 8 DOES THAT FOR
YOU AUTOMATICALLY ðŸ˜Š
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



<---------------WHATS NEW----------------------->
    
          --AUTO SUGGEST--


1)WORD CRACK 2 IS A SUCCESSOR OF WORD CRACK. WORD CRACK 2 NOW SUGGESTS WORDS USING A POWERFULL ALGORITHM THAT SELECTS MOST PROBABLE WORDS THAT CAN BECOME THE 
ANSWER
2)ONLY USE SUGGEST WORDS (OPTION 6) AFTER ENTERING THE INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE PARTICULAR COLUMN
3)THE USER CAN ALSO GUESS WORDS MANUALLY BY USING OPTION 5. BUT DO FOLLOW INSTRUCTION 6 OF NOTE.


	--WORD--RANKING--SYSTEM--

1)WHEN OPTION 6 IS USED , A LIST OF WORDS WOULD BE DISPLAYED WITH A CERTAIN NUMBER , RANGING FROM 3-5.
2)HIGHER THE NUMBER , GREATER THE CHANCE THAT ONE OF THE LETTER(S) IN THE WORD WOULD BE IN THE FINAL ANSWER
3)THEREFORE CHOOSING THE WORD WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OFFERS HIGHER PROBABLITY OF GETTING THE ANSWER

-PS THE ALGORITHM MAY SUGGESTS WORDS THAT MIGHT NOT BE COMMONLY USED , THEREFORE THE USER MIGHT NEED TO OPT THE WORD CAREFULLY




NOTE---->

1)THE SUCCESS RATE OF THE PROGRAM DEPENDS UPON THE AMOUNT OF DATA YOU FEED INTO THE PROGRAM
2)USE THE DEFAULT WORD LIST(pw_list.dat) OR THE SECONDARY WORDLIST(w_list.dat) . THE DEVELOPER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE IF THE PROGRAM FAILS DUE TO THIRD PARTY 
WORD LIST
3)FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY TO GET THE DESIRED OUTPUT
4)DO NOT OPEN THE SQL DATABASE WHILE RUNNING THE PROGRAM , IT WOULD RESULT IN THE PROGRAM SLOWING DOWN
5)IT IS ADVISED TO VIEW THE POSSIBLE WORDS WHEN IT IS AROUND 100-200 RANGE, IT MIGHT OTHERWISE SLOW DOWN THE PROGRAM
6)USE OPTION 5 TO VIEW THE POSSIBLE WORDS , AND CHECK WHICH LETTER REPEATS THE MOST , AND ENTER A WORD THAT HAS THAT LETTER.(THIS HELPS TO NARROW DOWN TO THE 
DESIRED WORD)
7)ANY SUGGESIONS ARE WHOLEHEARTEDLY WELCOME FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROGRAM
8)THE UPDATES FOR THE WORDLIST WILL BE PROVIDED


UPDATES---->

1)w_list.dat IS REPLACED BY pw_list.dat WHICH MAKES THE GUESSES FASTER
2)THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN MEMORY OPTIMIZED
